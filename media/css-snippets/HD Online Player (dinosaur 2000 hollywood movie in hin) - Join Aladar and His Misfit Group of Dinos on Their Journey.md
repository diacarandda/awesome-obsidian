The movie also has some interesting trivia and behind-the-scenes facts that may surprise or entertain you. For example, did you know that the movie was originally intended to have no dialogue at all, but Michael Eisner, the head of Disney at the time, insisted on including it? Or that the movie was one of the most expensive movies released in 2000, with a budget of $127.5 million? Or that the movie used a Carnotaurus as the main antagonist instead of a Tyrannosaurus rex, because the latter had been portrayed as a sympathetic character in The Lost World: Jurassic Park (1997)?
 
Another trivia fact is that the movie was inspired by an earlier project by Phil Tippett and Paul Verhoeven, who wanted to make a darker and more realistic movie about dinosaurs using stop-motion animation and live-action actors. However, their project was cancelled and Disney acquired the rights to their script and concept art. Disney then decided to make their own version of the movie using computer animation and live-action backgrounds. The original script by Walon Green was also revised several times by different writers and directors.
 
Despite its mixed reception, the movie has gained a cult following over the years and has been praised for its technical achievements and emotional impact. The movie also spawned a video game adaptation, a toy line, a comic book series and a spin-off TV show called Dinosaur Planet (2003), which featured different stories and characters set in the same world as the movie. The movie is also considered to be one of Disney's most underrated and overlooked animated films.
