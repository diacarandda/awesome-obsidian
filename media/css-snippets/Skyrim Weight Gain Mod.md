If you ever wanted to make your character more realistic in Skyrim, you might be interested in mods that allow you to gain and lose weight depending on your actions. In this article, we will introduce you to some of the best mods that let you do that and how to install and use them.
 
## WeightMorphs
 
WeightMorphs is a mod that makes it possible to gain and lose weight using the body morphs that mods like CBBE, Unified UNP and SAM come with. When eating food, ingredients or drinking potions, your player character gains weight. Walking, running, sprinting and jumping results in losing weight again. There are optional gameplay effects for stamina and movement speed reacting to your weight. The vanilla food (Skyrim.esm) is divided into three categories: light, medium and heavy. All DLC food and custom food coming from mods and all potions/ingredients are automatically added to the list you choose in the MCM menu. You can also have them unassigned. It is also possible to add the "WMLight", "WMMedium" or "WMHeavy" keywords to any mod items in their plugin[^1^] [^2^].
